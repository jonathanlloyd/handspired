# Handspired
A flappy-bird clone built to test out ideas from the Handmade Hero series
 - [Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaTznQhurW5AaiYPbhEA-KA)
 - [Outstanding Tasks](./TODOS.md)

Uses SDL2, so not handmade - handspired. However, should be a good testing
ground for things learned whilst watching the series.

# How to build
```bash
$ make
```
